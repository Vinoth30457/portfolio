      <p className="description">
        Hello there! I'm a 21-year-old guy with a love for web development. I
        enjoy creating beautiful and accurate websites that you can see and
        interact with. Learning about new technologies excites me, and I always
        keep an eye out for the latest trends. When I'm not working on websites,
        I like to explore my artistic side by drawing incredibly realistic
        pencil sketches.
      </p>
      <p className="welcome">
        Welcome to my portfolio website, where I share my passion for both web
        development and art!
      </p>
